# python-api-challenge

This project demonstrates how to use Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to analyze weather data and understand how temperatures change as we approach the equator. By fetching real-time weather data from an API and visualizing it, we empirically prove that temperatures increase closer to the equator.
